soundrip
=========

It's pretty simple actually, just rips music from soundcloud because
somtimes they feel like removing the download button.

```
$ soundrip
usage: soundrip URL [...]
```
where `URL` is the url of the track's soundcloud page.

# Installation

Just make sure the packages in requirements.txt are fulfilled.
`pip install -r requirements.txt` and that the soundrip script is
somewhere in your path.

Enjoy.
